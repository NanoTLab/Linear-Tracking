# Linear-Tracking

Linear Paul Trap Tracking algorithm

Code useful to treat videos from Linear Paul trap experiments.

Apart from things that come with Anaconda, one might need to install trackpy and its dependency, pims (to handle videos):

    conda update conda
    conda install -c conda-forge trackpy
    conda install -c conda-forge pims

Based on Trackpy Library, more information on:
